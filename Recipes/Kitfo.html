    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Kitfo is a traditional Ethiopian dish made of minced raw beef, typically seasoned with spices like mitmita (a spicy chili powder) and niter kibbeh (clarified butter infused with herbs and spices). It is often served with injera, a sourdough flatbread common in Ethiopian cuisine, and accompanied by side dishes like ayib (a soft cheese) and greens.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 pounds lean beef, such as boneless knuckle or top round</li>
        <li>1/2 cup kibbeh (seasoned clarified butter) or ghee</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mitmita (Ethiopian spiced chile blend)</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground korerima (black cardamom)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon koseret powder (earthy, woodsy dried Ethiopian herb)</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon fine salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Cut the beef into thin slices, trim any fat and then mince into very small cubes, preferably by hand, or in a food processor. Set the beef aside, spreading it over a plate.</li>
        <li>Melt the kibbeh in a medium skillet over very low heat. Add the mitmita, korerima, koseret and salt and stir with the butter. Then, add the minced beef and mash to mix it with the spiced butter; keep mixing until the beef reaches your desired temperature, 3 to 5 minutes for rare</li>
    </ol>
