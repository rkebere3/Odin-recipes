    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Shirowot, also known simply as "shiro," is a flavorful and hearty stew that is a staple in Ethiopian cuisine. It is a thick, spicy dish made primarily from ground chickpeas or lentils (though other legumes such as split peas can also be used), seasoned with a blend of spices and often cooked with onions, garlic, and tomatoes. The dish typically has a smooth texture, although it can vary depending on personal preferences and regional variations.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup of Chickpea flour</li>
        <li>2 cup of Water</li>
        <li>1 large Onion</li>
        <li>3 Garlic</li>
        <li>2 pieces of tomato</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon of berbere</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of slat</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> Place the onions in a dry saucepan or Dutch oven (no oil). Add a generous pinch of salt and saute over medium heat until they start to brown. Add water, a tablespoon at a time, if needed to keep them from sticking to the pan.</li>
        <li>Add garlic and mix it in. Saute a couple of minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in the tomatoes and mix.</li>
        <li> Let the tomatoes cook, stirring frequently, until they are very soft and pulpy.</li>
        <li>Stir in the chickpea powder and mix well until no dry flour remains in the pan</li>
        <li>Add the berbere and paprika. Mix well and then slowly trickle in 2 cups hot water into the chickpea mixture, whisking as you go. You can add a couple more tablespoons of niter kibbeh at this point for even better flavor</li>
        <li>Bring the shiro to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and let it cook 10-15 minutes until the chickpea flour has lost its raw flavor, the shiro has thickened, and little droplets of oil can be seen on top. Shiro should be thick, but if it is too thick for your liking, you can whisk in up to Â½ cup more of hot water.</li>
    </ol>
